# GitOps CI/CD Pipeline with ArgoCD

Hey there, fellow DevOps enthusiast! 👋 Welcome to awesome GitOps CI/CD pipeline project. I'm using ArgoCD to automatically deploy my super cool (albeit simple) web app to Kubernetes clusters. No more manual deployments - we're living in the future!

## What's this all about?

- 🚀 Continuous Integration with GitHub Actions
- 🎭 GitOps-style Continuous Deployment with ArgoCD
- 🔄 Zero-downtime deployments using a blue-green strategy
- 🐳 Containerization with Docker
- ☸️ Kubernetes for orchestration

## Project Structure

This completes our GitOps-based CI/CD pipeline project using ArgoCD. Here's a brief overview of what I've created:

1. A simple Express.js web application with health and version endpoints.
2. A Dockerfile to containerize the application.
3. Kubernetes manifests for blue-green deployments.
4. A GitHub Actions workflow for continuous integration.
5. An ArgoCD application manifest for continuous deployment.
6. A comprehensive README file with instructions and explanations.

## To use this pipeline:

1. Push changes to the main branch.
2. GitHub Actions will build and push a new Docker image.
3. ArgoCD will detect the changes in the Git repository.
4. ArgoCD will update the Kubernetes deployments.
5. The blue-green deployment strategy will ensure zero-downtime updates.

You can customize this pipeline further by adding more services, implementing additional deployment strategies, or integrating with other tools in your DevOps ecosystem.
